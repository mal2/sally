"description": "In the Occupied Palestinian Territories, although the law does not provide any explicit protections for LGBTQ persons, there are no formal laws against same-sex sexual activities. It should be noted, however, that laws against \u201cindecency\u201d are sometimes used, on an irregular and unpredictable basis, to criminalize same-sex acts. Officially, consensual sexual activities in private between members of the same sex who are at least 15 years of age are not illegal. Laws against sexual assault, rape, and indecency apply equally, regardless of the sex of the parties involved. This is not to say life is \"easy\" for LGBTQ Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. However, the problems they face are not primarily legal in nature but pertain more to social and cultural circumstances."
